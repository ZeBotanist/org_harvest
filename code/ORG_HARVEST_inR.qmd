# Introduction  
The goals of this exercise are to:  
- Create an analytical workflow for a **split-plot RCBD** with **random blocks**, from data import through publication-ready plot  
- Understand each of its components  

# a) Setup  
Here is where we load the packages we will use.  
```{r setup}
# Loading packages
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and plotting
library(car) # for Anova function
library(lme4)
library(broom) # for model residuals extraction
library(emmeans) # for model mean extraction
library(multcomp) # for pairwise comparison letter display
```
